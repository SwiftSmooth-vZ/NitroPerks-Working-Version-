# NitroPerks-Working-Version-
Since the owner abandoned NitroPerks, I decided to upload a working version of it.
To use it go to the plugins folder via discord and settings and drag the .js file over there.
Enjoy. (Also the previous owner why did you abandon it and make it useless? It was working fine)
